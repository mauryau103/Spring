package com.language_fundamental.types_of_variables;

//based on the value represented by the variables
//variables are divide into two part
//1. Primitive  variables; --> this are used to represent primitive values;
//int x=10;
//2.Reference variables; -->it is used to refer the objects.
//Student  s= new Student();



///Now Based on the purpose and positions of declaration of variable now there are divided into three types;;;

/*
 * 1.Instance Variables-->
 * a.Instance variables are defined inside a class not inside a methods.
 * b.If the value is varied from object to object such types of variable are called as instance variable.
 * c.for every object a separate copy of instance variables will be created.
 * d.instance variable will be created at a time of object creation and destroy at the time of object distruction.
 * e.hence the scope of instance variables is exactly same as scope of objects.
 * f.instance variable will be stored in the heap as a part of the object.
 * g.instance variable can be accessed directly from instance area .but cannot be accessed directly from static area.
 * h.by using object refrence we can access instance variables.
 * 
 * 2. Static Variables
 * a.it can be defined anywhere but we have to use static keyword or we have to defined it inside static block.
 * b.
 * 
 * 3. Local Variables
 * a.local variables are defined inside method or any scope 
 * b.local variable should be initialized always.
