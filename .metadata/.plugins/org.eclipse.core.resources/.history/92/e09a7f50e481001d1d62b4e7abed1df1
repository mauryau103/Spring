//Any service requirement specification is called an interface.
//inside interface every method is by default every method is abstract.
//Any service requirement specification (SRS) or any contract between client and service provider or 100% pure abstract classes is considered as an interface.

//whenever we are implementing the methods of interface inside class.it's compulsory to be declared as a public otherwise we will get compile time error . that we are lessering the scope size if we have'nt define public.

//methods -->by default public and abstract.
//variables --> public,static,final

//method naming conflicts
